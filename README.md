# Big Red Button

It's big.
It's red.
In this exceedingly theatric reference implementation, it'll send a Ctrl-V to whatever USB host it's connected to.
We used it at the public launch of my university's [Science DMZ](https://fasterdata.es.net/science-dmz/) to start a set of big downloads, so that the assembled VIPs could watch a Grafana bandwidth gauge redline.
