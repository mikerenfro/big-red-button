# Big Red Button

It's big.
It's red.
In this exceedingly theatric reference implementation, it'll send a Ctrl-V to whatever USB host it's connected to.
We used it at the public launch of my university's [Science DMZ](https://fasterdata.es.net/science-dmz/) to start a set of big downloads, so that the assembled VIPs could watch a Grafana bandwidth gauge redline.

## Code

Found in [big_red_dmz_button.ino](big_red_dmz_button.ino).
Should be easy to follow, and you can easily change which IO pins the switches are connected to and what key combination you want to send when they're both switched.
